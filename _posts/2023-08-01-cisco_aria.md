This file is what I studied while learning Cisco and networking, and it contains documentation and some information for configuration. The file includes rich references and basic information.

## ðŸš€ introduction
"My journey of learning Cisco began during my time at Vocational High School, majoring in Computer Networking (TKJ) at SMK Harapan Bangsa. From there, I started seeking knowledge on YouTube, exploring the web for documentation, and practicing at school. This journey allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the world of Cisco and networking, and I continue to learn and grow in this field."
